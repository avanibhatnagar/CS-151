Read Chapter 4
Question 2
Write a class BankAccount that implements the Comparable interface type. Order bank accounts
by increasing balance. Supply a test program that sorts an array list of bank accounts
Question 3
Write a program that shows a frame with three buttons labeled “Red”, “Green”, and “Blue”, and
a label containing an icon showing a circle that is initially red. As the user clicks the buttons, the
fill color of the circle should change. When you change the color, you need to invoke the repaint
method on the label. The call to repaint ensures that the paintIcon method is called so that
the icon can be repainted with the new color.
Question 4
Write a program that shows a frame with two buttons labeled “Zoom in”, and “Zoom out”, and a
label containing a car icon. As the user clicks the buttons, the car should get larger or smaller. As
in Question 3, you need to invoke the repaint method on the label to trigger a redisplay of the
image.
