In this homework, write a program that contains two frames, one with a column of text fields
containing numbers, and another that draws a bar graph showing the values of the numbers.
When the user edits one of the numbers, the graph should be redrawn. Use the observer pattern.
Store the data in a model. Attach the graph view as a listener. When a number is updated, the
number view should update the model, and the model should tell the graph view that a change
has occurred. As a result, the graph view should repaint itself.
